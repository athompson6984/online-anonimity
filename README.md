online-anonymity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR network is a network that connects many different volunteer's computers to create a complex network, which then can encrypt the information of a user accessing the internet. This means that a user who is connected to the TOR network can access websites without risk of being traced by people such as the government or secret services.

```
A network where a user can be anonymous can have many different advantages. It ensures user safety when accessing the internet, meaning that they cannot be "spied upon" by the government, secret services or people who may cause them harm. Many people are paranoid about this happening to them and therefore may want to go the extra step to ensure their online anonymity and safety. 
As well as this, people in countries that are dangerous to be in for certain people (for example, if they are at war or are targeting certain minority groups for things such as religion, race etc) can recieve help from charities or people outside their country through this network, where they can access and talk to different people without being traced and found by the government or people who are making their life difficult. This also means that oppressed people can better organise protests or meetings of groups of people without the risk of government intervention.

However, the ability to use this network can be dangerous for many different reasons.
